# Salary and Finance
 # Problem: 
 I am looking for a job and I want to calculate my take home pay using online calculators were inaccurate or not updated. I want to track my monthly expenses and compare it from my take home wage. 
 # Solution:
 This application will take in user input like wage per hour, or salary and output the take home salary. for the bills and subscriptions it will just take all and output the total spent per month. Its very basic calculation since online take home salary isn't accurate (note: this is calculating on 2024 tax rate on income tax in California) 
 How it works 
## Calculate Take home 
- It will take in user provided information ex. Salary or hourly and calculate the tax.

- Unless user prompts to continue with the bills and subscriptions or end the program. 
## Subscriptions

- calculates it. 
- outputs.
