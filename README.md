# Salary and Finance
 Problem: I had a problem when I constantly was using an online take home salary to find out that it was completely wrong for California 
 Solution: This application will calcuate the take home salary. This will also take your take home pay and subtract any bills and subscriptions. 
# How it works: 
## Calculate Take home 
- It will take in user provided information ex. Salary, married or single, etc
- It wil then calculate your take home pay from the information you provided. 
- Unless user prompts to continue with the bills and subscriptions or end the program. 
## Subscriptions 
- takes in all user subscriptions and bills 
- calculates it. 
- outputs.
